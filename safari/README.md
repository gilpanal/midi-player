# Extensions for Safari

## midi-player.safariextension

For older versions Safari v.11 and below.

Apple have removed these from the App Store, but one can install these from the source code if required.


## midi-player

For Safari v.12 and up.

For those without a developer certificate,
Safari requires quite a ceremonial dance *each time* you need to reload the extension:

- Go to `Safari`->'Preferences'->`Extensions` and uninstall the previous version of the extension
- Quit Safari completely (with `âŒ˜-Q`)
- Start Safari
- Check the `Develope`->`Allow Unsigned Extensions` menu item
- Run the extension app (can do it from Xcode)
- In `Safari`->'Preferences'->`Extensions` click the checkbox to enable the extension
